# Libellus Event Tools
A set of tools meant to help with the conversion and editing of the PM1/PM2/PM3 file formats found in various games created by Atlus, ranging from SMT Nocturne to Persona 4 Golden.

These files are referred to as PMD (short for Polygon Movie Data or PolyMovieData) and are structured pretty much the same expect for a different number in the header.

## Current Features
- Conversion of PMD to and from JSON

## Supported PMD Versions
- 12
  - Used in Persona 3 (Original and FES), Persona 4 and Persona 4 Golden
